// === State ===
// Here, we define variables for the data that our program needs to remember.
// We call this data "state" because it represents the state of our program.
// This is also where we define functions to modify the state.

/** Adds a shape with random properties to the `shapes` array */

// === Render ===
// To "render" is to update the DOM to reflect the current state.
// In this section, we define the functions to render state.

/** Updates the DOM to reflect the current state. */

// === Script ===
// In this section, we call the functions that we've defined above.

// `setInterval` will call the callback function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
// and return an interval ID that we can use to stop the interval later.
// Calling `clearInterval(addShapeIntervalId)` will stop the interval.
